title: TRUE STORY.
---
My father had a dream that he found a baby with long fingers. When he woke he prophetically proclaimed his unborn son was destined to be a musician. So naturally when I first hit the stage at age 5, it set the unusual precedent for the expansive career to come.
 
A difficult adolescence found me seeking ways to deal with the often-unbearable day to day struggles. I found sanctuary in a community musical theatre company, where my love for all things music and performing was nurtured and grown into a brilliantly burning passion. For 10 years I starred in numerous musical theatre productions and studied every aspect of performance from acting to stage combat choreography to directing, building a resume of hundreds of credits.
 
At the same time, I was experimenting with songwriting and home recording, and began to pour feelings of love and loss into my lyrics. In 2010, my freshman album Under the Radar featured a collection of songs about memories of love, solemn regrets & unrequited longing for something a little beyond ordinary.
 
Now a proud father, my most recent project is a way to wear his heart forever on his sleeve. Heavy rock ballads blend together with vividly poetic descriptions to confess some of those thoughts we sometimes struggle to find the words for.
 
Quoted as having the longest list of musical inspirations a reporter had heard of, I always strive to find new sounds to express the ever-evolving emotions of a love-sick Rockstar.
